                    <p>
                        Ransomware attacks are a prevalent form of cyber extortion. Cybercriminals encrypt a victim's data and
                        demand a ransom for its release. Organizations must implement robust security measures and response
                        plans to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.

                        Phishing and social engineering attacks rely on deception to manipulate individuals into divulging
                        confidential information, such as login credentials and financial details. Organizations must educate
                        their workforce about these threats and implement preventive measures to thwart such attacks.
